- This is just faster demo of a AST based diff tool
  - see original site:
    http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~yw21/demos/paredit20-paredit22.html

- Purpose of this project simply accelerate the render speed of above page.

- RANDOM WHY NOT: 
  (for those who want to improve original project architecture)
   - why not hook on github?
     user can post a commit url, then get a fine diff page, that's
     will be cool
   - why not move parser to browser?
     if parser can run on user's machine, there would be zero load on server.
